# Password Generator with GUI

A secure and user-friendly password generator built with Python, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) designed using `tkinter` and styled with `ttkbootstrap`.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: Built with `tkinter` and enhanced with `ttkbootstrap` for modern styling.
- **Customizable Passwords**:
  - Set password length.
  - Include or exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Random Password Generation**: Ensures strong and unpredictable passwords using Python's `random` and `string` modules.

## Demo

Run the password generator locally and use the intuitive GUI to generate secure passwords.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used to implement the password generator.
- **Libraries**:
  - `tkinter`: For creating the GUI.
  - `ttkbootstrap`: For modern styling of the interface.
  - `Pillow (PIL)`: For handling images and icons.
  - `string` and `random`: For character sets and randomization.
  - `math`: For additional mathematical operations (if needed).
